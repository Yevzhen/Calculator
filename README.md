# Calculator

Simple web-based calculator 

# What the app does: 

It is a simple calculator with basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

# How to use the application:

1. Before running the web app, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:
   
   <b>Web Server:</b> Apache or Nginx (with PHP support)
   
   <b>PHP:</b> Version 7 or higher (recommended)

3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  
4. Set up a web server on your machine. For instance, XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) or MAMP for macOS provides an easy-to-use interface to start your web server and database server. If using XAMPP, place the project folder in the htdocs directory.

5. Start the web server. If using XAMPP, start the Apache server from the XAMPP or MAMP control panel. Once the web server is set up and running, open your web browser, navigate to localhost followed by the name of the project directory. For example, http://localhost/calculator/. The PHP calculator should now be accessible in your browser, and you can start using it.

5. Using the App:
   
- Open the app in the browser, and you will see the calculator interface.

- Select an operator (+, -, *, /, or pow) from the dropdown.
